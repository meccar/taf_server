Layers Overview
1. Domain Layer
The Domain layer contains the core business logic and domain entities. It is independent of any external frameworks, infrastructure, or other layers.

Entities: Core business objects that represent concepts in the problem domain.
Aggregates: Groups of entities treated as a single unit.
ValueObjects: Immutable objects that represent descriptive aspects of entities.
Repositories: Interfaces that define data access operations but do not contain implementation details.
The Domain layer is the heart of your application and should be as isolated as possible from other concerns.

2. Application Layer
The Application layer acts as an intermediary between the domain and infrastructure layers. It contains use cases, application services, and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).

Interfaces: Defines application service interfaces that define the operations available for use cases.
Services: Contains application service implementations that orchestrate business logic and domain operations.
DTOs: Objects used to transfer data between layers, typically simplifying complex domain models for communication.
The Application layer doesn't contain any business logic but orchestrates the flow of data and interactions between the other layers.

3. Infrastructure Layer
The Infrastructure layer implements the technical details and external services. It is responsible for providing concrete implementations of interfaces defined in the Domain or Application layers.

Data: Implements the actual data models and access logic (e.g., ORM mappings, SQL queries).
Persistence: Contains database access logic, such as repositories, and persistence configurations.
Services: Provides integration with external services or frameworks (e.g., email, logging, file storage).
The Infrastructure layer depends on both the Domain and Application layers but should not reference the Presentation layer.

4. Presentation Layer
The Presentation layer contains the user interface (UI) elements and is responsible for interacting with the user. This layer depends on the Application layer to handle user actions and return the appropriate data.

Controllers: Handle incoming HTTP requests and route them to the Application layer.
Models: Represent data structures used in views, typically simplified or mapped from domain models.
Views: UI components that present data to the user.
ViewModels: Objects that hold data to be presented in the UI, often composed of one or more domain models.
The Presentation layer is isolated from the business logic and relies on the Application layer for data manipulation and interaction.

Key Principles
1. Dependency Rule
The core rule of Clean Architecture is that dependencies should always point inward. The outer layers (Presentation, Infrastructure) can depend on the inner layers (Application, Domain), but the reverse should never be true. This ensures that the core business logic is independent of technical concerns.

2. Separation of Concerns
Each layer has a distinct responsibility and should only interact with adjacent layers. This allows for better maintainability, testability, and flexibility.

3. Testability
By isolating the business logic and using interfaces to define boundaries between layers, the architecture promotes ease of testing. Each layer can be tested independently, and mock dependencies can be used in unit tests.

4. Scalability
The modular nature of Clean Architecture makes it easier to scale the system over time. New functionality can be added with minimal changes to the existing codebase.

Getting Started
To get started with this project:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clean-architecture-example.git
Install dependencies (for example, if using Node.js):

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure the necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).

Run the application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Running Tests
The project is structured to support unit and integration tests. Tests should be placed in a /tests directory at the root level or within corresponding layer folders.

To run tests, you can use your preferred testing framework. For example, with Jest:

bash
Copy code
npm run test
Design Decisions
Separation of Business Logic and Infrastructure: The business logic is isolated in the Domain and Application layers to prevent tight coupling with infrastructure and frameworks.
Use of Dependency Injection: Dependencies are injected into classes rather than being instantiated directly, which improves testability and flexibility.
DTOs for Data Transfer: Data transfer objects are used to simplify communication between layers, reducing the need to expose complex domain models.
Conclusion
This Clean Architecture structure provides a solid foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and testable applications. By organizing code into clear, independent layers, it ensures that the system can evolve without introducing unnecessary complexity.
